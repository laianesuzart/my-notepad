## about

My Notepad is a simple and user‑friendly application that lets you add to-dos (checklists) and notes by pressing Enter. To edit an item, just double-click the card and press Enter to save or Esc to cancel. You can also delete items using the Delete button, which becomes visible when hovering over a card.

For to-do cards, you can mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox. You may also delete completed tasks — or all tasks at once — using the actions below the input field.

You can also reorder your to-dos by dragging the reorder icon on each item.

The platform includes light and dark themes, and you won’t need to switch them every time — your theme preference is saved in localStorage. All your to-dos and notes are also stored locally, so feel free to add as much as you want! 😄
